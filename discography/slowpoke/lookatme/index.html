        <p>I hung up the phone<br>
          I cried on the couch<br>
          I really hoped nobody was around<br>
          <br>
          I got in my bed<br>
          Cried myself to death<br>
          How could the silence be so loud<br>
          <br>
          In a few months' time, you stopped on by<br>
          Told me you missed your best friend, we could make it right<br>
          Then a few months later, you're lying to me again<br>
          <br>
          Told you it's too late, I'm done with it<br>
          I'm cutting you off, I'm sure you'll be missed<br>
          You didn't care in the first place; I have an ego to defend<br>
          <br>
          Go ahead, live in your little world<br>
          I didn't want to live in it with you anyway<br>
          There's two types of people: the lovesick fools, and the ones who got away<br>
          <br>
          So look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me<br>
          Say something, say something, say something, say something<br>
          Pray for me, prey on me, what can you take from me<br>
          Gain nothing, gain nothing, it's all a game honey<br>
          <br>
          Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me<br>
          Say something, say something, say something, say something<br>
          Pray for me, prey on me, what can you take from me<br>
          Gain nothing, gain nothing, it's all a game honey<br>
          <br>
          I know I sound bitter, it's what I am<br>
          The prophecy is true, I'm not a real man<br>
          Whatever that's supposed to mean<br>
          You look at me like a freak<br>
          <br>
          Since you've been gone, things haven't gotten better<br>
          A girl will break your heart, but only if you let her<br>
          A boy shoots you down, despite all your letters<br>
          Drowning in apologies, and unisex sweaters<br>
          <br>
          And I only ever came back because I missed you<br>
          I told you I loved you every time I kissed you<br>
          Should we dream, or have our nightmare?<br>
          Why do I ask someone who doesn't care?<br>
          <br>
          I pick up my phone just to call your name<br>
          Can't think of what on earth I would even say<br>
          I just wanted you to take the pain<br>
          <br>
          I miss you<br>
          I miss you<br>
          I miss you<br>
          I miss you<br>
          <br>
          Things don't get any easier when you leave<br>
          The time comes back to haunt you, you wear your trauma on your sleeve<br>
          So I'll kill the butterflies, they're just demons in disguise<br>
          Don't you look into their eyes, they want your soul, they want your mind<br>
          <br>
          Do what you want<br>
          Say what you will<br>
          But you'll never know<br>
          The void that you filled<br>
          <br>
          Do what you want<br>
          Say what you will<br>
          But you'll never understand<br>
          The void that you filled<br>
          <br>
          I love you<br>
          I love you<br>
          I love you<br>
          I love you
