        <p>My food just doesnt taste good anymore<br>
          My head's split open all over the floor<br>
          Everybody's telling me my own business, and I felt the need to say<br>
          That I'd always love you<br>
          <br>
          I'm really really honest<br>
          I don't know how to speak<br>
          My mind still reels, from earlier<br>
          As I overthink the moment<br>
          You told me that you'd never lie<br>
          Was the moment that I knew I'd always love you <br><br>
          Love falls apart<br>
          It's a dangerous game<br>
          For our loved ones to play<br>
          Teach them to feel the pain<br>
          They're at that hungrier state<br>
          That kid never knew the neglect he faced<br>
          You talk about unfair but you could never relate<br>
          And yet I come back<br>
          And you say I love you<br>
          <br>
          Have I reached far enough yet?<br>
          Cause my muscles are getting tired<br>
          And there's gaps in my memory<br>
          And if I still thought I owed you some sick fantasy<br>
          I'd break my bones and spell out the words "I love you"<br>

          <br>
          I'm stuck in these walls<br>
          Drywall cemented to my skin<br>
          As it makes its way into my lungs<br>
          I'd cough for days<br>
          I've never felt this way<br>
          And you hung up the phone without<br>
          Saying I love you<br><br>

          But what if I'm wrong?<br>
          What if you've been right all this time<br>
          Self expression is a crime<br>
          I should've dropped my knees for you on the dime<br>
          But pleasing you is a waste of time<br>
          If you'll how I look or what I am inside<br>
          And if you wonder why<br>
          I could never look you in the eye<br>
          <br>But no matter how much you've done<br>
          I'll always love you<br>
          <br>It's like you've already won<br>
          How could you?
